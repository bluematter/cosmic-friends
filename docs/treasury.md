# Revenue Allocation & Treasury Compensation Model

This document explains **where money goes when characters earn** and how treasury funds can be allocated, including whether founders/managers can earn legitimate compensation.

This ensures transparency, trust, sustainability, and fairness.

## 💰 Where Does Money Go When Characters Earn?

When a character earns from:
- livestream tipping
- paid interactions
- sponsorships
- licensing
- other on-chain income streams

Revenue can be routed into **three possible buckets**, depending on the final design.

---

## Option A — Everything Goes to the Main Treasury (Simple Mode)

**Flow**
Character Earnings → PROJECT_NAME Treasury

**Benefits**
- Simple
- Transparent
- Ideal in early MVP
- Treasury grows continuously
- Governance has maximum power
- No complexity in accounting

**Trade-off**
Characters don’t have individualized economic identity.

This is recommended for **V1**.

---

## Option B — Split Between Treasury + Character Wallet

**Flow**
Character Earnings →
- % to Treasury  
- % to Character Sub-Treasury

Each character has their own wallet / sub-fund that can be governed by:
- the holder of that character
- governance voting
- hybrid rules

**Why this is cool**
- Characters become financially *independent beings*
- Popular characters naturally gain more power / initiative funding
- Creates economic storytelling
- Increases emotional + financial attachment to specific characters

**Example Split**
- 60% Treasury  
- 30% Character Sub-Treasury  
- 10% “Ops/Manager Fee” (explained below)

Split is configurable via governance.

---

## Option C — Everything Goes to Character Wallet (Experimental Mode)

This is the **“true AI sovereign being”** path.

Revenue Route:
Character Earnings → Character Wallet Only

Treasury earns indirectly through:
- mint auctions
- royalties
- ecosystem fees

**This path is philosophically interesting**
But harder to sustain in early stages.

Not recommended for V1.

# 🧠 Can Founders / Managers Earn?
Short answer: **YES — and they should, BUT transparently and governance-approved.**

If you *don’t* compensate:
- founders burn out
- project dies
- incentives become misaligned
- you end up tempted into shady behavior

So we intentionally **design compensation into the protocol**.

---

## 🏛 Treasury → Manager / Founder Compensation

There are three ethical + scalable ways to do this.

---

### ✅ Option 1 — Explicit Manager Fee (Standard DAO Practice)

Treasury revenue can route:
Treasury Income → Smart Contract  
Smart Contract → Automatically allocates a % to:
- Founders / Core Team
- Or a “Core Contributor Fund”

Example:
- 5% – 10% ongoing protocol fee
- Paid automatically
- Visible on-chain
- Governance-ratifiable

This is how:
- protocols
- DeFi DAOs
- Web3 orgs
sustain long-term.

---

### ✅ Option 2 — Salary / Stipend Model

DAO Governance approves:
> “Founders receive X per month as operational compensation.”

This feels like:
- a startup
- with founders paid for operating work

Transparent, community approved.

Downside:
Requires more DAO voting.

Upside:
Super clean & ethical.

---

### ✅ Option 3 — Performance Based

You’re only paid if:
- metrics are hit
- growth achieved
- milestones completed

This can be:
- % of streaming revenue
- % of auction price
- bonuses for hitting milestones

This aligns incentives perfectly.

# ⚖️ Smart Contract Implementation Concept

### Treasury Smart Contract Splitter

When funds enter:
- configurable split logic
- governance adjustable
- immutable transparency

Example Pseudologic:
