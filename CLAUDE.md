# CLAUDE.md - Cosmic Friends Development Guide

This document is the north star for all code we write. Every feature, every line, every decision should align with this thesis.

## The Mission

Build the **first AI-native, crypto-powered, community-owned character civilization** that doesn't die after hype — but becomes a living cosmic universe of friends.

**We are NOT building:**
- Another NFT project
- A pump-and-dump
- Static collectibles
- Boring DAO infrastructure

**We ARE building:**
- A living cultural machine populated by autonomous AI beings
- Characters that think, stream, create, and earn
- A community-owned creative studio
- Something worth belonging to

## Core Thesis

```
Money follows culture.
Culture follows story.
Story follows characters.
Characters live here.
```

Every technical decision should reinforce this flywheel.

## Guiding Principles for Code

### 1. Characters Are Alive, Not Static

When building character-related features:
- Characters produce content autonomously (daily posts, thoughts, streams)
- Characters have personality, voice, emotional states, and memory
- Characters can earn, interact, and evolve
- Characters are economic actors, not just art

**Ask:** Does this make characters feel more alive?

### 2. Community Governs Culture, Not Just Treasury

When building governance features:
- Governance should feel like running a creative studio
- Community controls the algorithm (tone, chaos level, narrative pacing)
- Governance over behavior, emotion, story — not just budgets
- Simple, playful, meaningful, empowering

**Ask:** Does this give the community meaningful creative power?

### 3. Treasury Funds Culture

When building treasury/economic features:
- Every mint/auction feeds the treasury
- Treasury funds creative grants, worldbuilding, experiences
- Transparent compensation for contributors is built-in
- The guiding question: "Does this push the universe forward?"

**Ask:** Does this help culture compound?

### 4. Crypto-Native, Not Crypto-Awkward

When integrating blockchain:
- Use crypto where it adds real value (ownership, governance, transparency, tipping)
- Don't force crypto where it creates friction
- On-chain where it matters, off-chain where it doesn't
- Streaming tips, character wallets, treasury splits — all native

**Ask:** Does this feel natural to internet-native users?

### 5. Fun Is A Requirement

When designing UX and features:
- The internet should be fun again
- Internet weirdness is a feature, not a bug
- Playful > corporate
- Drama = attention = value

**Ask:** Would someone actually enjoy using this?

## Technical Architecture Principles

### Content Engine
- Daily "routine" content: posts, memes, thoughts, reactions
- Periodic "feature" content: videos, story arcs, collaborative scenes
- Autonomous livestream mode with TTS, emotional arcs, chat interaction
- Economic streaming: tips trigger emotions, unlock scenes, influence thoughts

### Personality Engine
Each character needs:
- Defined traits and personality embedding
- Tone, morality, humor, worldview
- Emotional baseline and triggers
- Interests and content preferences
- Voice identity and visual style

### Governance-Controlled Algorithm
Store on-chain, readable by AI:
- Global culture sliders (wholesome ↔ chaos, funny ↔ serious, etc.)
- Character-level tuning (post frequency, content type, emotional range)
- Seasonal "eras" that shift the entire universe mood
- Transparent algorithmic constitution

### Treasury System
- Simple MVP: all earnings → main treasury
- Future: split between treasury + character sub-wallets
- Built-in founder/contributor compensation (transparent, governance-approved)
- Revenue routes: auctions, tips, licensing, partnerships

### Smart Contract Considerations
- Cadence-based minting (daily or weekly)
- Treasury splitter contracts with configurable logic
- Governance that's simple and playful
- Character metadata: name, personality, lore, voice, visual identity

## What We Avoid

- Over-engineering before we have users
- Boring DAO hell (governance should be fun)
- Static NFT mentality (characters must feel alive)
- Hype-first thinking (culture-first always)
- Spam and cringe robotic outputs
- Complexity that doesn't serve the mission
- Features that make characters feel less alive

---

## Quality Bar

Before shipping any feature, verify:

1. **Alive Test:** Does this make the universe feel more alive?
2. **Culture Test:** Does this create or enable cultural moments?
3. **Fun Test:** Would someone enjoy this?
4. **Ownership Test:** Does this make holders feel like they own "someone" not "something"?
5. **Simplicity Test:** Is this as simple as it can be while achieving the goal?

---

## The Flywheel (Always Remember)

```
1. Cosmic Friend is born
2. Mint/auction funds treasury
3. Treasury funds culture + experiences
4. Culture → attention
5. Attention → value & network effect
6. Repeat forever
```

Every line of code should serve this loop.

---

## Success Looks Like

- People check in because something is *happening*
- Characters feel recognizable and beloved
- There are memes, lore, inside jokes
- External communities talk about us
- Treasury does cool shit
- People flex ownership for belonging, not just money
- The universe never feels silent

---

## The Dream

Dozens... hundreds... eventually thousands of independent AI beings:
- Living
- Speaking
- Streaming
- Thinking
- Earning
- Evolving

All tied to a treasury, a DAO, a universe, a cultural movement.

**COSMIC FRIENDS: The first crypto-native AI civilization.**

*Let's build something that deserves to exist.*
